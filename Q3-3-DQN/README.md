## Q learning

# Usage:

OpenAI gym provides a number of different environments for reinforcement learning research. For this particular Q-Learning task, I used two such environments from openai gym. The hyperparameters are setup for the following environments based on the environments name. 
1. CartPole-v0
2. MountainCar-v0

To initiate training, and automatically set the hyperparameters based on the environment, please type:
```python
python DQN_Implementation.py --env <environment name>
```
